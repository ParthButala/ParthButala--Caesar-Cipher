 ParthButala--Caesar-Cipher
 Project Title: Caesar Cipher

Description:

The "Caesar Cipher" is a Python application designed to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm, a classic substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a specified number of positions in the alphabet, either forward or backward.

Key Features:

Encryption:

Users can input a message and a shift value (integer) to encrypt the text. The program shifts each letter by the given value, wrapping around the alphabet when needed, and outputs the encrypted message.

Decryption:

To decrypt a message, users input the encrypted text along with the shift value used during encryption. The application reverses the process, shifting each letter in the opposite direction to reveal the original plaintext.

Input Validation:

The application ensures that user inputs consist only of alphabetic characters and verifies that the shift value is a valid integer.

User-Friendly Interface:

Featuring a simple command-line interface (CLI), the utility allows users to easily select encryption or decryption, input messages, and specify shift values.

Case Preservation:

The program maintains the case of letters during encryption and decryption. Uppercase and lowercase letters remain as they are in the output.

Error Handling:
The application provides clear error messages to guide users in correcting any invalid inputs.

How to Use:

Run the program.
Choose between encryption ('E') or decryption ('D').
Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Specify the shift value (integer).
The application will display the encrypted or decrypted result.
